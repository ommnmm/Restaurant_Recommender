Abstract
This work researches recommender systems that recommend restaurants to target users. We experiment two approaches within the collaborative filtering algorithm, including memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering. Given that the experiment performs on a small data set of size O(1000) , the result implies that these algorithms may be viable for predicting user ratings and generate hits for user recommendations of restaurants. The result from model-based collaborative filtering is slightly better than collaborative filtering that only uses user similarities, but a bigger data size may yield more reliable results.
